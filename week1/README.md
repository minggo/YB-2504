These two tasks are to make us be familar with some NumPy conceptions. After I finishing the activies, I am more familiar with the axis:
- axis = 0 means the column
- axix = 1 means row

If the array has more dimentions, then it becomes more complex.

And I know why NumPy is import, because it extends the ability of python array. Many builtin functions are provided. They are convenient. As I am used to c++, so the feel is strong, for example, you can just multiply an array like multilpy a number. And I am sensitive to memory management, so I just create a new object when it is needed as new object will add pressure to gc.
