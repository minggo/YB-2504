1- Activity : Create a NumPy array of the first 10 positive integers. Then:
Print the array.
Print the shape and data type of the array.
Multiply each element by 2 and print the result.
 
2- Activity : You are given the test scores of 5 students across 3 subjects in a 2D NumPy array. Each row represents a student, and each column a subject. See below:
 
scores = np.array([
    [78, 85, 90],
    [88, 79, 92],
    [84, 76, 88],
    [90, 93, 94],
    [75, 80, 70]
])
 
Tasks:
Calculate and print the average score for each student.
Calculate and print the average score for each subject.
Identify the student (row index) with the highest total score.
Add 5 bonus points to the third subject for all students.
